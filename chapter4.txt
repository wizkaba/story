life is hard but never blame people for your misfortune always have a hustler mentality never hate or love if you don't know who you are dealing with so please be careful who you meet on the side way or else will surely regret it i'm on a project of self-improvement so i don't consider people hating on me i know oneday with dedication even if one door closes another will surely open by the grace of god inshallah one day i will stand and be laughing and say things i learn and understood before has paid todays so thanks..
